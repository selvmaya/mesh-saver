# Unity-MeshSaver
A C# Editor Script that allows you to save a usable Mesh .asset file into your project.

# How to Use:
Right click on a MeshFilter component's label or click on its gear icon to open up its context menu. Then select either "Save Mesh..." or "Save Mesh As New Instance...". Note that "Save Mesh..." will not work if the mesh comes from an imported 3D asset/prefab.
